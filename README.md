# Cerberus-Magic-Mirror
Cerberus Magic Mirror is a Python + OpenCV augmented-reality camera application for Kali Linux, created by Sudeepa Wanigarathna. It turns your webcam into an interactive “magic mirror” with multiple real-time modes: a Harry Potter–style Invisibility Cloak, creative Air Drawing on the live feed, and a spooky Ghost Trail motion effect.
